Fixed parser to allow #include inside a class (broken by v1.1.16.01).
Fixed Clipboard returning binary CF_HDROP data in some instances.
Improved accuracy of FileGetSize on files which are still open.
Improved for-loop to work with COM objects which either don't resolve the name "_NewEnum" to DISPID_NEWENUM, or which implement _NewEnum as a property rather than a method.
